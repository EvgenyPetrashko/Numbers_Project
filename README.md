# Numbers_Project

Application idea:
1) Handbook of mathematics and algorithms
2) A tool for quickly calculating the properties of a number
3) If the application is downloaded to the PlayMarket, then people can check their luck every day by participating in the lottery for guessing the numbers

4) Code cleaning
5) Adding comments
