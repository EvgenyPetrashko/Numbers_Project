<b>Greatest common factor</b> of two integers a and b are called the largest natural numbers d such that a is divisible by d and b is divisible by d.<br><br>

The greatest common divisor exists and is uniquely determined if at least one of the numbers m or n is not zero.<br><br>

<b>Naive algorithm for finding GCD:</b><br>
In a naive way, we assume that we know the prime factorizations of the numbers a and b. We just need to make an intersection of the two divisor lists.<br>The time complexity: is the minimum length of the lists.<br><br>
<b>Subtraction Algorithm:</b><br>
It can be formulated as follows:<br>
If two natural numbers a and b are given, then while a is not equal to b, you need to subtract the smaller from the larger. Then we have 2 outcomes:<br>
1) In the process of subtractions, one of our numbers became one, and the other did not, which means that GCD = 1.<br>
2) In the process of subtractions, one number became equal to another - this number is the GCD of our numbers<br>
The time complexity: O (n).<br><br>
<b>Euclid\'s Algorithm:</b><br>
It can be formulated as follows:<br>
If you are given two natural numbers a and b, then until a is equal to b or one of the numbers is not equal to one, you need to continue division with the remainder, i.e. take the remainder of dividing (mod) a larger number by a smaller one and write it to a larger one. As in the previous algorithm, if one of the numbers becomes equal to one, then this is the GCD.<br>
The time complexity: O (log (min(a, b)))

This algorithm finds all primes from 2 to n.<br>
1) Write out all the numbers from 2 to n<br>
2) Take the first number (in order), let it be p, and cross out all other numbers starting with 2p that are divisible by p.<br>
3) After we have done this, find the first uncrossed number greater than p and repeat step 2.<br>
4) Repeat until p is greater than n.<br>
5) All remaining numbers are prime.<br><br>
This algorithm can be improved by the fact that in step 3 you can start deleting not with 2p, but with p ^ 2. Accordingly, the algorithm can be stopped when p ^ 2 becomes greater than n.

The simplest algorithms for finding the fibonacci number n are:<br>
<b>1) Recursive solution</b><br>
Pseudocode:<br>
int fib (int n) {<br>
&#160;if (n &lt;2) return n;<br>
&#160;else return fib (n-1) + fib (n-2);<br>
}<br>
This method is very simple, but it takes (fi) ^ n time, where <i>fi is the golden ratio.</i><br><br>
<b>2) Dynamic solution:</b><br>
Pseudocode:<br>
int fib (int n) {<br>
&#160;if (n &lt;= 2) return 1;<br>
&#160;int [] array = new int [n + 1];<br>
&#160;array [1] = 1;<br>
&#160;array [2] = 1;<br>
&#160;for (int i = 3; i &lt;= n; i ++) {<br>
&#160;&#160;array [i] = array [i-1] + array [i-2];<br>
&#160;}<br>
&#160;return array [n];<br>
}<br>
This method is more complicated than the previous one, but it already requires O (n) time and O (n) memory.<br><br>
<b>3) An elegant solution:</b><br>
Pseudocode:<br>
int fib (int n){<br>
&#160;int x = 1;<br>
&#160;int y = 0;<br>
&#160;for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i ++)<br>
&#160;{<br>
&#160;&#160;x + = y;<br>
&#160;&#160;y = x - y;<br>
&#160;}<br>
&#160;return y;<br>
}<br>
This solution requires O (n) time, but already O (1) memory.

<b>RGB</b> is a color coding color model where the primary colors are red, green and blue, respectively.<br><br>
To get RGB, you need to translate the desired number into a hexadecimal number system <i>(remember that RGB can encode only 2 ^ 24 colors and if the desired number is greater than this, then you need to find the remainder of dividing this number by 2 ^ 24 and use the result).</i><br><br>
After converting the number to the hexadecimal number system, you need to put zeros in front of the number if the number has less than 6 digits. It remains to put a lattice in front of the number.<br><br>

<b>A number system</b> is a system of writing numbers using a specific set of numbers (which depend on the base of the system). The most common number systems (bases) are binary (2), octal (8), decimal (10) and hexadecimal (16).<br>
The minimum base is 2, the maximum base is 36.<br>
In a base n number, there cannot be a digit greater than or equal to n.<br>
There are 2 ways to convert from decimal to others:<br>
1)<b>Sequential division (the process of division is performed until the remainder of the remaining number is less than the base of the number)</b><br>
2)<b>Finding the nearest number of the degree of base not exceeding the current one with subsequent subtraction.</b><br>
Explanation for the second method:<br>
1) Take the number 326 and translate it into a ternary number system.<br>
2) The closest number not exceeding 326 is 243 (remember that this is 3 to 5 degrees).<br>
3) Subtract 326 - 243 = 83 - the current number.<br>
4) The closest number not exceeding 83 is 81 (remember that this is 3 to 4 degrees).<br>
5) Subtract 83 - 81 = 2 - the current number.<br>
6) 2 does not exceed the degree of the base.<br>
7) Therefore, we have one at the fifth and fourth positions, as well as the number 2 at the zero position, the desired number 110002 (the numbering of positions starts from right to left starting from 0).<br><br>
Conversion to the decimal number system is carried out according to the following algorithm:<br>
1) Take a number with a numeral system n, put down positions starting from right to left from 0. (Let\'s translate 110002 from ternary)<br>
2) The corresponding digits in the number are multiplied by the base in the power of the position, all these sums are added. (1 * 3 ^ 5 + 1 * 3 ^ 4 + 0 * 3 ^ 3 + 0 * 3 ^ 2 + 0 * 3 ^ 1 + 2 * 3 ^ 0 = 326 is the desired number)<br>
In number systems with a base greater than 10, in addition to digits, Latin letters are used, so for example, in the hexadecimal system, the letters correspond to the following numbers in decimal: A - 10, B - 11, C - 12, D - 13, E - 14, F - 15.
